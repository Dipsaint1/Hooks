***************UseState**************
i.  Updating the state triggers a re-render.


***************UseRef****************
i.    The value of useRef persist i.e it stays the same between re-renders
ii.   Updating the ref does not trigger a re-render (that's the huge difference between useRef and UseState)
iii.  useRef can be used to set focus on an element
iv.   Never use useRef to grab the value of an input, use useState to work with values.
v.    Only use useRef to create a reference to something in a component (setting a focus is a prime example)
